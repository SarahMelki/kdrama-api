# My kDrama Hub: [Visit Here](https://kdrama-hub-api.herokuapp.com/)

Here is a list of all the kDrama series I watched and consolidated into an api. To see all the data, use this link: https://kdrama-hub-api.herokuapp.com/title
To check a specific kdrama, use this link: https://kdrama-hub-api.herokuapp.com/title/KDRAMA-NAME

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express.js, hosted on Heroku


## Optimizations
It would be great to add a description for every kdrama and work more on the CSS on the client side.

## Lessons Learned:

Enjoyed making use of a long list of kdrama shows I had saved on a spreadsheet and create my own API using node and express.
